## Abstract 

<p align=justify>
@NCHS is a new mobile application developed for students at North Creek High School. The primary goal of @NCHS is to provide a streamlined platform for students at North Creek High School that encompasses current and future utilization of technology on campus. Consistent with the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) Mobile Application Development [competetive event guidelines](https://www.fbla-pbl.org/media/2022/03/FBLA21001_CE_guidelines_FBLA_v2.pdf), the app includes the following required features: a schedling feature allowing students to input their schedule, information about extracurricular activities, a lunch menu, the ability to email teachers and staff, a calendar that is updated with school information, integration of social media platforms, and a bug reporting system. In addition, @NCHS is equipped with numerous additional features such as an announcements and updates tab system, a class start alarm, an extracurricular tracker, and SMART goal setter. These along with the under-the-hood security features of @NCHS work to enhance the North Creek High School Digital Experience and give the app a professional feel.

@NCHS was built with Apple's SwiftUI framework and the Firebase backend database structure and is deployable on iOS and iPadOS platforms. Our custom code paired with these frameworks enabled us to build a well-crafted app that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust.

2. Follow the provided instructions to download this repository as a ZIP file: https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/ <br>
3. Locate the @NCHS.xcodeprof file within the newly extracted @NCHS folder and open the file with XCode. <br>
4. After clicking open, click on the uppermost blue @NCHS file and change the provisioning profile to your own developer account. <br>
5. Build the project using the following instructions. Set the build scheme to @NCHS and ensure that the selected iOS simulator meets the prerequisites to view the application on iOS. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-and-running-an-app?changes=_8 
```

#### Optional
To directly download @NCHS onto your iPhone, plug your own phone into the computer using a Universal Serial Bus cable and select your phone as the iOS simulator. You may have to approve the application on your iPhone and ensure that your iPhone meets the prerequisites to view the application on iOS.

## Built With
**Frontend: Swift** <br>
- _Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS._ <br>
- Used for user interface and implementation.

**Backend: Firebase** <br>
- _Google's backend-as-a-service app development platform that provides hosted backend services such as a realtime database, cloud storage, authentication, crash reporting, machine learning, remote configuration, and hosting for static files._
- Used to enable Google account authentication and store user data, including schedule, tracker information, goals, and personal calendar.
- Powers communication-based features of app including announcements and updates, and staff additional abilities in these areas.

**Integrated Development Environment:** Xcode; Compatible with AppCode, CodeRunner, Visual Studio Code


Functioned as database structure running the Home Page, Resource Page, and all communication-related aspects of the application.
- These communication-related aspects included the interactive Announcements Page and Updates Page.
- Additionally, Firebase provided utilities for tracking analytics, and reporting and fixing application crashes.

## Security

@NCHS supports both a student view and a staff view mode, each with its own separate application. The staff view's TestFlight public link is not publicly displayed due to  the administrative abilities that come with it. In the "Updates" page, students will have the option of requesting an update, which will be received by other users. As a precautionary measure against spamming and inappropriate content, staff users will have the ability to confirm or deny student updates before they are published to other student users. This ability is enabled through the backend firebase powering the app. Additionally, only staff users may publish announcements to the homepage.
