>_Simplifying the North Creek High School Digital Experience_

**Project by Advaith Vijayakumar and Vishal Yalla (North Creek High School)** <br>
**FBLA Mobile Application Development Submission (2021 – 2022)**

## Abstract 
<div class=text-justify>
Aligned with the the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) Mobile Application Development competitive event guidelines, @NCHS is a new mobile application developed for students at North Creek High School. The app includes the following required features:
  
- a schedling feature allowing students to input their schedule
- information about extracurricular activities
- a lunch menu
- the ability to email
- teachers and staff
- and a calendar that is updated with school information.

and several other mainstream features of professional iPhone Operating System development. The application is designed to function alongside a stable firebase as a backend data structure that is used to support the home page, resource page, and all communication features of the application. @NCHS is designed to meet the needs that remove the barriers of North Creek students from thriving in the current educational state. This application was programmed entirely in Apple's SwiftUI language with a backend coded in a mix of Firebase and Python.

Root Pages, Support Pages, Classes/Objects _Two types of user accounts are supported by this application: a user account and staff account.

- Home Page (Student Support Pages: Announcements; Staff Support Pages: Announcements, Add Announcements; Class: AnnFormat)
- Updates Page (Student Support Pages: Request Update, Happening Now; Staff Support Pages: Review Request; Class: RequestType)
- Schedule Page (Student Support Pages: Input Schedule -> Course List, Teacher List, Class Start Notification; no staff view is provided for this page; Class: UserDefaults, NotificationManager)
Prerequisites for for Running Project and Viewing Code

# Developer Signing
- Mac Operating System
- XCode
- Alternative SwiftUI Integrated Development Environment (e.g. Mac Operating System: AppCode, Windows: Text editor such as Atom or SublimeText)
- **Recommended: iPhone or iPad Operating System with version 15.2 or newer.

# Installation Process

Download XCode from the Mac App Store and create a free developer account on Apple's Developer Portal.
Once you are done downloading XCode, download the @NCHS.xcworkspace file from this GitHub project.
Build the program and run the program on xCode's iPhone 8 simulator.
To access full application functionality, the following further process is recommended:

Connect your personal iPhone to the personal computer using a Universal Serial Bus cable plug.
Using the created developer account, select your phone to download the application.
Approve and trust the computer performing this action for the above step to properly function as expected.
Access full application functionality with local notification and emailing capabilities now unlocked.
Usage of application on a physical iPhone Operating System device is the running approach this program is designed for.

Built With
- Swift UI code for user interface and implementation.
- Integrated Development Environment: Xcode, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab
Backend Database Structure
- Google Firebase: an application development software used to develop Android, iPhone, and website operating systems.
Functioned as database structure running the Home Page, Resource Page, and all communication-related aspects of the application.
- These communication-related aspects included the interactive Announcements Page and Updates Page.
Similarly to the MySQL system software, its primary functionality is to ensure data integrity and eliminate database errors.
- Additionally, Firebase provided utilities for tracking analytics, and reporting and fixing application crashes.
